# CS217-YourBankStarter
Group project for CS217 - Agile Software Engineering in Practice 

Main focus of this project was to get real life experience working in a SCRUM team. We learnt how to get data from a banking API, run SQL statements and work with JSON data. Then display the findings in a very simple website.
